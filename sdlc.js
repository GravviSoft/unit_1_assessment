// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Second step involves figuring out which software requirements will be used to accomplish the projects end goals."
const design = "The third step focuses on developing the most effective design possible, in order to benefit the end user.  Programming languages are considered and selected."
const implementation = "The fourth stage is where the real coding takes place.  The blueprint has been created, now it's time for the project to come alive through long hours of coding and debugging."
const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth stage is all about testing the code to make sure everything works properly before it is rolled out to potential customers.  Issues can be detected and fixed to ensure a professional product."
const maintain = "The sixth step involves continually maintaining the code to make sure everything works properly over time.  Updates and new upgrades can also be developed during this stage.  The code is never finished, but always maintained."
